![Miller family reunion 2021](/assets/img/family_reunion_2021.jpg)

Welcome to the Miller family website. We share a common ancestor, Anders Anderson (Miller), who emigrated from Varmland, Sweden to Hartland, MN in 1869. Much of the family still lives in Southern Minnesota.

The website will contain details about the next family reunion or other family events. The biggest feature of the website will be our [online family genealogy](http://family.andersandersonmiller.com) that you can set up an account for and start contributing to.

Feel free to contact Reid Miller if you have any questions or comments about the site.
